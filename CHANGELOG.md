- Improved performance of modules with oversampling
- Improved performance of ChowDer tone stage

## [1.2.1] - 2020-09-12
- Fixed oversampling bug
- Fixed tape bug at low saturation levels
- Fixed IIR coefficient calculation for peaking filter
- Added manual links for individual modules
- Added publication links for Tape and Modal modules

## [1.2.0] - 2020-09-03
- New analog distortion module (ChowDer)
- Implement new GUI designs
- Improved performance for Tape module Newton-Raphson solver
- Improved performance for all IIR filters
- Improved documentation

## [1.1.0] - 2020-08-16
- New Recurrent Neural Network module.
- New modal filter module.
- Added 4x oversampling to Chow Tape.
- Refactored delay lines to use Lagrange interpolation instead of sinc
  interpolation. This improves performance and removes dependency on
  libsamplerate.

- Initial release for ChowDSP VCV Rack modules. Modules include
  tape model, phaser feedback, phaser modulation, and feedback
  delay network reverb.
